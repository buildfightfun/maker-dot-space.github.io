<h2>Welcome Makers!</h2>

<p>Thankfully the owner of this domain (<a style="color:#666;" href="http://twitter.com/briankb">@briankb</a>) is a MAKER and will use this awesome domain for the good of the Maker community. Initial use will be to allow verified non-profit Maker and Hacker spaces to create and use a subdomain from the maker.space TLD. We will also setup a currated directory to those and other websites. This page is hosted via Github Pages, feel free to make updates and send a pull request. A Logo competition is forth coming but again feel free to send your ideas on our github repo as a Issue or Pull Request</p>
