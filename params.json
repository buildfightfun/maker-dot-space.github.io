Initial use will be to allow verified non-profit Maker and Hacker spaces to create and use a subdomain from the maker.space TLD. We will also setup a currated directory to those and other websites. This page is hosted via Github Pages, feel free to make updates and send a pull request. A Logo competition is forth coming but again feel free to send your ideas on our github repo as a Issue or Pull Request",
