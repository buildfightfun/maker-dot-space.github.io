## Avoiding Phone Spam with Twilio!

I run a small company that has been around for over 12 years using the same telephone number. As such, that number is on ever list you can imagine. 

Also I have a dozen hobbies so answering the phone and trying to remain POILITE to the endless stream of sales calls is quite hard. I try my best, but I wasn't as polite this last call as I would like. It was yet another caller selling Printer Supplies, specifically toner. I tried to explain that in the past three years I've replaced my toner exactly once. That just lead to the second line asking when I last replaced it... blah blah blah. I hung up.

I've had an idea for helping to combat this for some time. Years ago I switched us off of our local telco and onto a $1mo number at Twilio, so far it has worked out great! The cost is hardly noticible and its dynamic depending on how many calls get picked up on our cells once they are forwarded.

So my idea is to ask the caller to answer a specific question once they choose someone to speak to. The information they need isn't hard to find, go to our website and you can find it. But it's probably just enough to make these random sales callers to move on to the next person. In the mean time those callers who are trying to reach me or someone at our company could either already know the answer or take 30 seconds on eyespike.com to find it.
